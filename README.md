- 👋 Hello there, I’m @iafrohack
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud services (GCP, AWS), specifically how they are leveraged to 
solve various problems. Serverless concept, Events-driven architecture (AWS lambda, GCP cloud functions), 
containerized deployments (Docker in AWS EC2, GCP compute engine, GCP Cloud Run). I love Python for my backend, 
and prefer single page apps (currently well-versed in vue.js).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning all-things cloud (GCP & AWS)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cloud-based projects, anything in Python or vue.js
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can email me at iafrohack@gmail.com with any questions or if you would like to work together with me!
